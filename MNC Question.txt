Problem Statement – Chaman planned to choose a four digit lucky number for his car. His
lucky numbers are 3,5 and 7. Help him find the number, whose sum is divisible by 3 or 5 or
7. Provide a valid car number, Fails to provide a valid input then display that number is not a
valid car number.
Note : The input other than 4 digit positive number[includes negative and 0] is considered as
invalid.
Refer the samples, to read and display the data.
Sample Input 1:
Enter the car no:1234
Sample Output 1:
Lucky Number
Sample Input 2:
Enter the car no:1214
Sample Output 2:
Sorry its not my lucky number
Sample Input 3:
Enter the car no:14
Sample Output 3:
14 is not a valid car number

XYZ Technologies is in the process of increment the salary of the employees. This
increment is done based on their salary and their performance appraisal rating.
If the appraisal rating is between 1 and 3, the increment is 10% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 3.1 and 4, the increment is 25% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 4.1 and 5, the increment is 30% of the salary.
Help them to do this, by writing a program that displays the incremented salary. Write a
class “IncrementCalculation.java” and write the main method in it.
Note : If either the salary is 0 or negative (or) if the appraisal rating is not in the range 1 to
5 (inclusive), then the output should be “Invalid Input”.
Sample Input 1 :
Enter the salary
8000

Enter the Performance appraisal rating

Sample Input 3 :
Enter the salary
-5000
Enter the Performance appraisal rating

In a theater, there is a discount scheme announced where one gets a 10% discount
on the total cost of tickets when there is a bulk booking of more than 20 tickets, and
a discount of 2% on the total cost of tickets if a special coupon card is submitted.
Develop a program to find the total cost as per the scheme. The cost of the k class
ticket is Rs.75 and q class is Rs.150. Refreshments can also be opted by paying an
additional of Rs. 50 per member.
Hint: k and q and You have to book minimum of 5 tickets and maximum of 40 at a
time. If fails display “Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 Tickets”. If circle is given a
value other than ‘k’ or ‘q’ the output should be “Invalid Input”.
The ticket cost should be printed exactly to two decimal places.
Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of ticket:35
Do you want refreshment:y
Do you have coupon code:y

Problem Statement – Write a program to calculate the fuel consumption of your
truck.The program should ask the user to enter the quantity of diesel to fill up the
tank and the distance covered till the tank goes dry.Calculate the fuel consumption
and display it in the format (liters per 100 kilometers).
Convert the same result to the U.S. style of miles per gallon and display the result. If
the quantity or distance is zero or negative display ” is an Invalid Input”.
[Note: The US approach of fuel consumption calculation (distance / fuel) is the
inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance ). Also note that 1 kilometer is
0.6214 miles, and 1 liter is 0.2642 gallons.]
The result should be with two decimal place.To get two decimal place refer the
below-mentioned print statement :

float cost=670.23;
System.out.printf(“You need a sum of Rs.%.2f to cover the trip”,cost);
Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
20
Enter the distance covered
150
Sample Output 1:
Liters/100KM
13.33
Miles/gallons
17.64
Explanation:
For 150 KM fuel consumption is 20 liters,
Then for 100 KM fuel consumption would be (20/150)*100=13.33,
Distance is given in KM, we have to convert it to miles (150*0.6214)=93.21,
Fuel consumption is given in liters, we have to convert it to gallons
(20*0.2642)=5.284,
Then find (miles/gallons)=(93.21/5.284)=17.64
Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
-5
Sample Output 2:
-5 is an Invalid Input
Sample Input 3:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
25
Enter the distance covered
-21

Sample Output 3:
-21 is an Invalid Input
